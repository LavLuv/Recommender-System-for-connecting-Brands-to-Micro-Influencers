# Recommender System for recommending Micro-Influencers to Brands using Instagram dataset

Using a dataset of Instagram posts (images and captions) of various micro-influencers and brands (of various categories), building a Recommender System which, given the Instagram content of a brand, recommends micro-influencers to it for social media marketing  

This can have commercial applications as it can save brands the effort of having to manually examine and select from a humongous pool of micro-influencers. The recommender system makes this task easier by suggesting top choices to brands, based on visual and textual similarity between Instagram content of itself and the influencers
